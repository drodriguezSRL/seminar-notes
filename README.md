# Seminar notes

I've been attending seminars for over a decade now, taking endless notes that ended up filling dozens of notebooks, most of which just sat on a shelf afterward.
This is my attempt to change that. 

What follows is a collection of personal notes from seminars I've attended, primarily focused on topics like robotics, machine learning, perception, computer vision, and space operations and exploration. 

While I try to capture just-in-time info when possible, it's nice to have a place to come back to when I need to revisit and reflect on certain topics. 

They’re organized by major topics, usually based on whatever problems I’m working on at the time.
